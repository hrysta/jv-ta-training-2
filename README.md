1. Calculate number frequency in a list
Given a list of integers print appearance frequency of each number in the list.
Calculated frequencies should be printed in two different formats: list and histogram.
Example
Input data:
1, 4, 1, 5, 8, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4, 1, 3, 7, 2

Output in list format:
Frequency: 5, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1
Number: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Output in histogram format:
*
*
*
*   * * *
* * * * *   * *
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Requirements
The program should be implemented in JAVA language.
The program should accept input numbers as an argument either in command line or in UI.
Output should have all numbers from min(input) to max(output) even if they do not appear in
the input list.
The output should be nicely formatted.
The code should have tests.
The code should be efficient, OOP is encouraged.
